#My approach to making this web site

I was greatful for the opportunity to show off some of my skills i have developed, and thought it would be great opportunity to do some php.

I decided to make the template first with html and css, once i felt it looked beautiful, I then used the phpmailer to set up a email to use with this website. The email will throw a error if you miss certain fields in the contact us section. If the email is successful it will redirect you to a thank you message, else it will tell you a error. I set up certain fields on the page that has "read more", to redirect you to, blog and services pages. With the contact us tab in the nav bar i just set it to bandv contact us. I was going to make the contact us a individual page, but felt that it should have been on the same page like the image you sent me. I also felt you should be able to view it on a smaller scale, so i pulled the whole page in, and rescaled it. You can see the images above. I also wanted this to be a live web page so i uploaded it on Heruko at https://evening-thicket-97313.herokuapp.com/.

#viewing mail
The email section is live so if you send a message you can log in and view the meassages that have been sent.
